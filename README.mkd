Logger
======

Log your actions in python interactive shell.

Important
---------
It doesn't play well with ipython just with python itself.

Usage:
------
```python
from logger import *
logger = Logger()
logger.start_log()

print 'foooo'  # the print output goes to the defined file (default: "python_log")

logger.stop_log()
```
